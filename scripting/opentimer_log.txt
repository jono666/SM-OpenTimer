Update log:

-------------
	v1.5
-------------
	- New database structure.

	- New recording file structure.
		* Old recordings will not work!
		* In case of database dying on us, we now include ALL THE DATA in the file header.
	
	- Changed cvar prefix to timer_ from sm_!
	
	- Added checkpoint zones!
		* A standard checkpoint: Allows players to compare their time to the record time.
	
	- You can now spawn as many freestyle, block and checkpoint zones as you please!
		* Less, the better for performance, of course.
	
	- Added modes. These modes are autobhop, scroll and velcap.
		* Each mode is their own separate category with own records and ranks.
		* Autobhop is just like normal, ezhop and everything.
		* Scroll and velcap both have no ezhop and have legit aa.
	
	- Added 'timer_def_airaccelerate' and 'timer_scroll_airaccelerate' cvars.
		* timer_def_airaccelerate defines what is the normal (autobhop, non-legit) sv_airaccelerate. (def. 1000)
		* timer_scroll_airaccelerate defines what is the scroll/velcap-mode sv_airaccelerate. (def. 100)
	
	- Better record text.
		* Time is now formatted MM:SS:SS(S).
		* Every time player joins the server or breaks pb/wr, we will print said player's rank.
	
	- Fixes and improvements
		* Records now store run's tickrate. Makes sure it's compatible with the server.
		* We now show a sprite in zone building menu where the zone would start.
		* Fixed zones not spawning correctly. (CS:GO)
		* Fixed hint text formatting and added more colors. (CS:GO)
		* Added cvars timer_maxbots, timer_fps_style, timer_allow_mode_auto, timer_allow_mode_scroll, timer_allow_mode_velcap, timer_def_mode.
		* We now only save player data when the player disconnects.

	v1.4.5

-------------
	v1.4.4
-------------
	- Fixes and improvements
		* Changed bot name format to show time.
		* We now shorten the player's name on the bot. This way we always see the time and mode.
		* Bot's full name and time is shown in the side info text.
		* Made spawning less shitty.
			* No more annoying team menus.
			* We automatically spawn the player after joining a team.
		* Changed some notations on variables.
		* Bots and players go to separate teams.
		* HUD no longer shows for spectators that are in free roaming mode.
		* Zone mins and maxs are now real mins and maxs. They are corrected on creation.

				* Less computing time.
		* Anti-cheat now prints a warning to the console if we found a cheating player.
		* Improved and fixed record display.
		* Added credits (!credits)
		* Renamed recording.sp to cmd.sp
		
-------------
	v1.4.3
-------------
	- Added experimental anti-cheat 'sm_ac_strafevel'-cvar
		* Whether we check if player has a strafe-hack that changes velocity but doesn't press keys. (basically style cheat)
		* Thanks to |-ICE-| Angel for cheating on my server so I realized this. :)
		
	- Small stuff
		* Decreased anti-spam time from three seconds to one.
		* Modified zone creation to be more reliable.
		* Bots no longer playback records if no players exist. <- Hoping to lower CPU usage while idling.
	
-------------
	v1.4.2
-------------
	- New sync that actually makes sense.
		* Works with controllers :D
		
	- Added Vel-Cap-style. Defaults to 400.

		* sm_allow_hsw
		* sm_allow_rhsw
		* sm_allow_vel
	
	- Fixed some dumb mistakes.
		* Changing cvars should actually work now.
		* RHSW works now.
		* Zones no longer translate to the next map if no zones were found from the database.
		* Made a fail safe for recording's tick count being too long but shorter than best time, therefore not being saved.
		* Prefixing and chat colors are now done in compilation instead of runtime. < faster
		* Bots and players won't die from falldamage anymore, lol. This is why testing is an actual job.
		* Bots have weapons again.
		* Disabled hiding players for now.
	
	Soz for not fixing these sooner.

-------------
	v1.4 & v1.4.1
-------------
	- Recording changed and file backwards compatibility breaks yet again (hence why version is 1.4 and not 1.3.x)!
		* DHOOKS is gone for good! < Server no longer stops responding after trying close it down.
		* Recordings should be a lot smoother now.
		* Smaller frame size yet again.
		* Hopefully the last change made to the file structure.
		* Added 'sm_smoothplayback' (def. 1) for those that want an option between smooth and accurate playback.

	- Practice mode changes
		* Multiple checkpoints (five by default).
			* Commands !last/!lastcp to go back to the latest checkpoint.
			* !cp/!checkpoint <num 1-5> will bring you to the specific checkpoint. If user inputs no number, they get a menu.
		* Players can noclip using the command !no-clip/!fly. (I know the name sucks, but I don't want to override an already existing command.)
		
	- Anti-Doublestep Technology(TM)
		* Tired of your client-side autobhop failing? Don't worry, because we have a solution!
		* Usually the client-autobhop presses a separate jump key when you hold down your spacebar, etc. 
		* By simply binding your spacebar to '+ds', you can prevent doublesteps completely!
		* Do note that this is for those that doublestep (lose speed randomly when bhopping.)
		
	- Other:
		* Instead of an MOTD page for the records, you get a menu.
		* Added help commands !doublestep and !version.
		* Divided code into smaller files. Makes things easier to find.
		* Previously mentioned !cp and !lastcp changes.
		* Sync isn't super dumb anymore. It's just dumb now.
		* Again, made things more reliable and stable.
		* Menus aren't dumb anymore either.
		* Made !commands more easier to read, and to edit in code.
		* Block zones now use triggers instead of normal zones.
		* You can no longer keep recording after you've gone past the best time.
		* Made bots show speed instead of completion time.
		* Misc. HUD changes.
		* Made sure the plugin doesn't search for recordings of runs of which don't have any zones.
		* Bots will now stop doing a playback if you delete the zone. (to-do: kick the bot.)

-------------
	v1.3
-------------

	- Moved to SourceMod 1.7 .
		* 1.7 syntax, yay!
			* const bug?
		* Will require 1.7 version of DHOOKS (v2.0) to compile.
			* You will have to do some changes in the dhooks.inc file in order to get it to work.
			* ^ There is an updated version in the DHOOKS thread if you're lazy.
			
	- Recording overhauled!
		* 1.2 records are not compatible with this new update!! Let me put this out there first.
		* Finally on par with other recording plugins. At least I think so :>
			* Recording is more precise. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much perfect now.
			* File sizes are smaller due to smaller frame size.
		* In case of the database being deleted, we now store the record time in the file header. Just in case...
		
	- Fixes:
		* People could leave the starting zone and start to float. No more...
		* There was a problem with one of the convars not working correctly. No more...
		* Made the plugin just generally more reliable.
		* Custom chat should show up now. It wasn't reliable.
	
	- Some components are disabled by default. (People don't necessarily want them.)
		* Map voting.
		* Custom chat processing.
		* Connect sound.
		
	- Other:
		* Added a new cvar 'sm_ezhop' to toggle EZHop. (def. 1)
		* Changed 'sm_autohopping' to 'sm_autobhop'.
		* Bots are now invisible.
		* Internal maximum players is now the default 64.
		* Made more SQL queries threaded. Meaning less hangups if at all.
		* Maximum recording changed to 45 minutes.
